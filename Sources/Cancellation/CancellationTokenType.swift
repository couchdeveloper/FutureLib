/**
 The protocol `CancellationTokenType` defines the methods and behavior for a 
 concrete implementation of a _cancellation token_. 
 
 A cancellation token is associated to a corresponding `CancellationRequest` 
 with a one-to-one relationship.
 
 A cancellation token starts out with an "undefined" state and can then be 
 completed with a value representing a "cancelled" or "not cancelled" state.
 Completion will be performed by its associated cancellation request value.
 Once a cancellation token is completed, it cannot change its state anymore.
 
 A cancellation token is passed from a client to a potentially long lasting task 
 when the client creates this task. The task may now observe the state of the 
 cancellation token via periodically polling its state, or it may _register_ a 
 handler function which will be invoked when the token gets completed. 
 
 When a client requested a cancellation the token will be completed accordingly.
 When this happens the task should take the appropriate steps to cancel/terminate 
 its operation. It may however also to decide _not_ to cancel its operation, for 
 example when there are yet other clients still waiting for the result. One 
 cancellation token may be shared by many observers.
