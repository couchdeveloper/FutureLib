/**
    The `CancellationTokenType` defines the methods and behavior for a concrete
    implementation of a `CancellationToken`. A cancellation token is associated to
    a corresponding `CancellationRequest` with a one-to-one relationship.

    A cancellation token's state is either "undefined", "cancelled" or "not cancelled".

    A cancellation token is passed from a client to a potentially long lasting task or
    operation when the client creates this task. The task will observe the state of
    the cancellation token or registers a handler function which let it know when
    the client has requested a cancellation.  When a client requested a cancellation
    the task should take the appropriate steps to cancel/terminate its operation. It
    may however also to decide _not_ to cancel its operation, for example when there
    are yet other clients still waiting for the result. One cancellation token may be
    shared by many observers.
