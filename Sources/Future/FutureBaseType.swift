     the cancellation token given in the parameters. If the mapping function
     throws an error the returned future will be completed with the same error.

     If the cancellation token is already cancelled or if it will be cancelled
     before `self` has been completed, the returned future will be completed with

     argument. Otherwise, executes the closure `f` on the given execution context
     when `self` is completed passing a tuple of the completed `self` and the
     cancellation token as the argument.

     been unregistered. If there are no other strong references and all continuations
     have been unregistered, `self` is being deinitialized.
