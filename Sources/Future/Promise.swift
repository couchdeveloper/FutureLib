/**
 A _promise_ complements a _future_ in that it provides the public API to
 create and complete a future _indirectly_ through an instance of a `Promise`.
 Note, that a future cannot be created neither can it be completed directly.

 When a `Promise` instance will be created it creates its _associated future_ which
 can be accessed through the property `future`.

 Usually, the promise will be created and solely owned by an object or a function
 that performs the underlying task which eventually _resolves_ the promise when
 the task is finished. When the promise will be resolved, it immediately completes
 its associated future accordingly.

 Once its future has been retrieved from the promise, the promise subsequently
 holds only a weak reference to its future. That means, if there is no other strong
 reference to the future and if the future does not have any continuations or if
 it has been completed, the future will be destroyed.

 The following example shows the typical use case:

 ```swift
 func asyncTask() -> Future<String> {
     let promise = Promise<String>()
     doSomethingAsyncWithCompletion { (result, error) -> Void in
         if let r = result {
             promise.fulfill(result)
         }
         else {
             promise.reject(error)
         }
     }
     return promise.future!
 }
 ```

 A promise can register a handler (a closure) which will be called when its
 associated future has been destroyed. A client can utilize this handler for example
 in order to cancel the underlying tasks - since when there is no future anymore,
 obviously there is nothing which is interested in the result anymore and the task
 can be aborted in order to release resources.
