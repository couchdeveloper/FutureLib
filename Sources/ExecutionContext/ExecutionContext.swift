/**
 An _execution context_ is used to execute a _closure_ or an _asynchronous task_
 whose result is represented by a `Future`. In the simplest case, an execution
 context is a "thread".
 
 Usually, an execution context manages an internal FIFO queue where these workloads
 will be stored until they get executed.

 An execution context may either execute enqueued "workloads" _serially_ or
 _concurrently_. Furthermore, with respect to the call-site, submitting a workload 
 for execution on an execution context is an _asynchronous_ function, but submitting
 workloads _synchronously_ may be a valid and a reasonable property as well.

 
 
 A closure has the signature `() -> ()` and will completely execute on the
 _execution context_. Usually, this is a CPU bound computation.
 
 An asynchronous task has the signature `() throws -> Future<T>`. In constrast to
 the closure, an _asynchronous task_ merely executes its "prolog" - code which
 initializes and invokes the underlying asynchronous call - executing on this 
 execution context, but the underlying work will execute asynchronously on one or 
 more different worker threads, queues or execution contexts. When the underlying
 task finishes, it must complete the returned future accordingly.
 
 
 An execution context _may_ be used to describe concurrency constraints for shared
 variables which will be accessed from operations performed in more than one closures 
 executed on the _same_ execution context. Concurrency constraints are only meaningful 
 for closures, since those actually execute on the given execution context. For
 _tasks_ other properties may be more important, for example the maximum concurrent 
 tasks which can be executed in one execution context.
 
 In order to define concurency constraints, an execution context may (implicitly)
 define a "synchronizes-with" and a "happens-before" relationship between operations
 performed on different closures which execute on the _same_ execution context -
 but not necessarily on the same thread.
 
 The ”Synchronizes-with” and "happens-before" relationship describes ways in
 which the memory effects of the program statements are guaranteed to become
 visible to other threads. In other words, if there is a synchronizes-with"
 and a "happens-before" relationship, then operations performed on different
 closures accessing shared variables is considered "thread-safe".
 
 The most simple way to achieve a "synchronizes-with" and a "happens-before"
 relationship is to let closures execute on the same thread - the thread
 identified as the _execution context_. Other ways to achieve this is to
 use mutex/critical sections, dispatch_queues etc.
 
 
 > Note: The FutureLib is completely agnostic to those properties of concrete
 implementations of an `ExecutionContext`.
